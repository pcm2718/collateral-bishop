\namesection{Status}

The current status of the assignment is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
        \item The source code compiles to a binary without error.
        \item The binary executable runs without crashing.
        \item A master file for training the genetic algorithm exists.
        \item Support exists for loading the master histogram.
        \item Support exists for distribution of the master histogram between all nodes.
        \item Boilerplate support exists for all features other than the fitness test.
\end{itemize}

The project could be completed fully with the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
        \item Completion of the histogram processing library.
        \item Implementation of the fitness test.
        \item Implementation of the boilerplate methods for mutation, crossover, migration and culling.
        \item Implementation of migration via MPI.
        \item Misc. boilerplate code and interface improvements.
\end{itemize}
