\hwtitle{Report for Assignment \# 3}{CS 5500}{Parker Michaelson}

The status of the assignment is as follows

\begin{itemize}
        \item Facilities exist for reading and writing ppm files to and from a histogram format.
        \item Facilities exist for evaluating the fitness of possible solutions relative to the master solution, which is represented as as histogram.
        \item Primitives for the genetic algorithm exist and are functional.
\end{itemize}

The major flaw in the assignment is currently an error preventing a final evaluation of the function due to a NULL pointer error, preventing output of the best solution as an image.
